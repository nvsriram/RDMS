# RDMS
<strong>Robot Database Management System </strong>created using datafile handling in C++. 
<p>This will work on <i>any</i> C++ IDE. Just copy the code, compile and run!<br> 
The program asks for user input and allows you to enter data of as many records as per user's requirement and lets you fill in details of the robot(s).
Then it leads you to a menu which allows you to: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Add records</li>
    <li> Modify existing records</li>
    <li>Delete records</li>
    <li>Search for records (based on serial number or name)</li>
    <li>Display all records</li>
  </ol>
 <p>Since it uses binary datafiles, you can update your database <i title="Terms and conditions apply">ANYTIME</i>.<br>
  Enjoy! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
